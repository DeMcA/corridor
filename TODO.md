# Corridor TODO
* legal player moves (straightforward but remember jumping)
* install some linting/prettier tools on new computer and cleanup
* do something when you win
* better Styling to show which turn (e.g. colour on Player number, highlight piece, etc.)
* [X] implement graph to check paths (prevent illegal wall placement)
* add service to mock backend AI communication (can return random legal move for now)
* are there redundant event handlers? (why did I think this?)
