# Corridor TODO
* Do something when you win
* Better Styling to show which turn (e.g. colour on Player number, highlight piece, etc.)
* implement graph to check paths (prevent illegal wall placement)
* add any useful interfaces/types (array/matrix data structures?)
* add unittests, especially (especially for legal move functions, ideally before getting too far into the graph service)
* add service to mock backend AI communication (can return random legal move for now)
* are there redundant event handlers? (why did I think this?)
