# Corridor TODO
* implement legal move functions (in their own module?)
* add interfaces/types
* add unittests, especially (especially for legal move functions)
* add service to mock backend AI communication (can return random legal move for now)
* style walls so holes in single, two-square-long pieces don't exist (and thus look like two separate bits of wall)
* better UI/styling, maybe remove overlapping divs (maybe split into multiple components at same time?)
* are there redundant event handlers?
* better way of inter-component communication in this use-case?
